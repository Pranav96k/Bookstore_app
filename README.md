## Introduction

This web application allows users to search for books and view their details. It fetches book data from a Flask API and displays it using a Next.js frontend.

## Features

- Search for books based on title or author.
- View book details, including title, author, genre, and publication date.
- Display whether the book is "Paid" or "Free" with button-like styling.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranav96k/Bookstore_app.git
Install the required dependencies for both the frontend (Next.js) and the backend (Flask).

Set up the Flask API to serve book data.

Start the Next.js frontend and the Flask API.

## Usage
Open the web application in your browser.

Use the search bar to search for books by title or author.

Click on a book to view its details.

See whether the book is "Paid" or "Free" with button-like styling.

## Tailwind CSS Styling
We use Tailwind CSS for styling our web application. 

## Displaying Book Details
We display book details including title, author, genre, and publication date. For displaying whether a book is "Paid" or "Free," we use the isPaid variable.

## Button-Like Styling for "Paid" or "Free"
We wrap the isPaid text inside a span element and apply Tailwind CSS classes to style it as a small button.
